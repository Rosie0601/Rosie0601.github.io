            Is the end of the virtual reality world the metauniverse? What is the underlying logic of the metauniverse? How should we correctly recognize, view, and embrace the future that has come?
Today's world is full of ups and downs, and various new technologies are emerging in an endless stream. The wave of technological revolution is surpassing each other, and the "meta universe" is undoubtedly the most popular concept among various technical terms in 2021.

The ‘Cyberspace’,  which was used 30 years ago, has suddenly become popular in the post epidemic era and has constantly appeared in the public eye. With Facebook officially renamed Meta, Microsoft announced its entry into the metaUniverse ecosystem, and the concept of" MetaUniverse "has completely gone out of the loop. Domestic large technology companies such as Baidu, Ali, Netease, Tencent and ByteDance have also entered the market.

So, what is the metauniverse? What is its emergence, development, and future direction? What kind of empowerment can it bring to our economic and social development?
