            Is the end of the virtual reality world the metauniverse? What is the underlying logic of the metauniverse? How should we correctly recognize, view, and embrace the future that has come?
Today's world is full of ups and downs, and various new technologies are emerging in an endless stream. The wave of technological revolution is surpassing each other, and the "meta universe" is undoubtedly the most popular concept among various technical terms in 2021.

The ‘Cyberspace’,  which was used 30 years ago, has suddenly become popular in the post epidemic era and has constantly appeared in the public eye. With Facebook officially renamed Meta, Microsoft announced its entry into the metaUniverse ecosystem, and the concept of" MetaUniverse "has completely gone out of the loop. Domestic large technology companies such as Baidu, Ali, Netease, Tencent and ByteDance have also entered the market.

So, what is the metauniverse? What is its emergence, development, and future direction? What kind of empowerment can it bring to our economic and social development?

            <h5> The Origin and Development of the Metauniverse
            </h5>
            <p>In 1992, Neal Stephenson's science fiction novel "Snow Crash" ("Avalanche") described a future setting in which real humans and virtual humans live together in a virtual space through VR devices. 
                In 1995, inspired by the novel "Avalanche," Ron Britvich created Active Worlds, which aims to create a metauniverse and provides basic content creation tools to transform the 3D social virtual world of virtual environments, attracting thousands of players to participate.
                In 2003, "Second Life" was released as the first phenomenal virtual world game. It has stronger world editing capabilities and a developed virtual economy system where people can socialize, shop, build, and do business. 
                Since then, Roblox has released the game "Roblox", which is compatible with virtual worlds, casual games, and user created content. Mojang Studios in Sweden has developed the game "My World", and the Metaverse themed movie "Top Player" has been released. Facebook has announced that Facebook Horizon has become an important node in the development of the Metaverse, including the social VR world.

            <h5>The underlying logic of the metauniverse
            </h5>
            <p>According to Google's definition of the Metaverse, Metaverse is a virtual world that is linked and created using technological means, mapped and interacted with the real world, and has a digital living space with a new social system. In short, the metauniverse is a digital world created parallel to the real world using new generation information technologies such as AR, VR, 3D, and AI.
                The future metauniverse should have five core characteristics:
                One is immersive experience. Immersive experience is our first pursuit of the metauniverse. When we enter the metacosmic world, we can ignore the outside world and immerse ourselves in it. Nowadays, many 3D games and 3D and 4D movies can only be regarded as the embryonic form of the metauniverse. In the future, in the metauniverse, it is possible for us to achieve immersive experiences of vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.

                The metauniverse is the ultimate form of digital transformation, and is expected to become a digital world that integrates entertainment, social interaction, learning, production, and life, closely integrating with the real world.

            <h5>Summary</h5>
            <p>Metacosmic technology is a comprehensive integration and new trend of human scientific and technological revolution, which will greatly change human production, communication, and social life, and greatly change people's concept of time and space. Perhaps, in the near future, the true picture of the metauniverse will be something we cannot imagine at present. However, with the advent of every emerging technology and every major change, countless new things will emerge, many new scenarios will be presented, a batch of new organizations will be born, and thousands of new opportunities will be revealed.
