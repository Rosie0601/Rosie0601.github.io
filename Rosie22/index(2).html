How should we correctly recognize, view, and embrace the future that has come? Today's world is full of ups and downs, and various new technologies are emerging in an endless stream.

Domestic large technology companies such as Baidu, Ali, Netease, Tencent and ByteDance have also entered the market. So, what is the metauniverse? What is its emergence, development, and future direction? What kind of empowerment can it bring to our economic and social development?</div>
